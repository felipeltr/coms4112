Running the program is rather simple. There is a MakeFile that will automatically build and will produce a build executable. Simply type "make" into the terminal. Make sure that you are inside the directory where all the files are. Once the "make" command is done, the code should compile and output the build executable. This can be ran in by "./build 10 10 2 3 4". This will produce the tree of values as well as a visual of every value in each level. The tree is sorted and the format for showing the probes value and identifier is "For probe (PROBE) : (IDENTIFIER)". This should show the user where the value will be on the table.
